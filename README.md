# Data science on Reducing loss of clients from a telecommunication company

## Presented By; Philip Ochieng Oluoch

## Business Understanding:
###  Overview
A Telecommunication company offers communication services search as voice calls, messages, and internet services. Telecommunication companies make money by getting more clients to make use of their services on daily basis. When the company start losing its clients, this move leads to a financiall loss.

**challenge:** The poblem that has resulted to this project is the fact SyriaTel, a telecommunication company, has been experiencing losses due to withdrawal of customers. The company wants to understand the rootcourse of these problems. I have been assigned the obligation to figure out the problems and come up with solutions.

**solution:** Based on the variety of services offered, through machine learning, we ahould be at a position to figure out the services that do not favour our clients, the type of clients we serve and the services that they do prefer or use frequently. This move shall enable us to take the appropriate measures and make changes that will retain and attract more customers.

## Data Understanding
**source**We will use 'Churn in Telecom's dataset' from kaggle. The data entails 3,333 rows and 21 columns.

**target variable and relevant variables**
~The target variable is 'churn'

## Models
The models we used are:
#### Training models
>XGBoost, Logistic regression, Random Forest Classifier, Decission Tree Classifier
#### For evaluation
>Recall Score, ROC Curve,

## Results
From the running the project, it came to our attention that some factors contributed greatly to the loss of our clients.International plan,  Voice Mail Pla,   Customer Service Ca are some of the features that had the greatest impact.

### Recommendations
From the study, I would advise the company to standardise the service charges and make it favourable to its clients. Its preferable to make substantial profits for a long period of time rather than 'overcharge' and eventually lose clients. They should also offer better services to international clients. Lastly they should drastically improve the customer service experience to frequent customers. In additon ll
